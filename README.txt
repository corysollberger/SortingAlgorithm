A Python Program -- Created by: Cory Sollberger

The program is intended to produce a GUI that a user will use to produce a Graphic depicting the resulting
data sort through various implementations of sorting algorithms.

These algorithms include:
- Quicksort
- Mergesort
- Timsort
- Heapsort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Tree Sort
- Shell Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Radix Sort
- Counting Sort
- Cubesort

Currently Implemented Algorithms:
- Quicksort

Currently being developed, these features need to be implemented
- GUI for User Selection
- Exporting of data using Matplotlib
- Algorithms not implemented

A little project to get better at python programming using python libraries
