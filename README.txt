A Python Program -- Created by: Cory Sollberger

The program is intended to produce a GUI that a user will interact with to visualize
data sort through various implementations of sorting algorithms.

These algorithms include:
- Quicksort
- Mergesort
- Timsort
- Heapsort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Tree Sort
- Shell Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Radix Sort
- Counting Sort
- Cubesort

Currently Implemented Algorithms:
- Quicksort
- Insertion Sort

Currently being developed, these features need to be implemented
- GUI for User Selection, I've decided to go with Tkinter as my GUI
- Tkinter used instead of MatPlotLib, although that functionality might be implemented in the future.
- Algorithms not implemented

A little project to get better at python programming using python libraries
